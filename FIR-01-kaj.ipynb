    "This assignment is divided in 4 parts, which have to be delivered all together no later than 04/10/2023 at 23:59 (strict - no extensions will be granted!) via Canvas. Delivery of the assignment solutions is mandatory (_see grading conditions on Canvas and in slides of Lecture01_).\n",

    "We will use [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) as search engine. It provides state-of-the-art tools to implement your own engine, index your documents, and let you focus on methodological aspects of search models and optimization. \n",

    "The assignment is about text-based Information Retrieval and it is structured in three parts:\n",
    "1. IR performance evaluation (implementation of performance metrics)\n",

    "3. Implementation and optimization of models of search (Similarity)\n",

    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"1000\": set([\"1341\", \"1231\"]),\n",
    "        \"1001\": set([\"12332\"])\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will use a dictionary called `all_retrieved` with `query_id` as key, and as value a [Python list](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) of document identifiers retrieved by the IR system:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"1000\": [\"1341\", \"12346, \"2345\"],\n",
    "        \"1001\": [..., ..., ...],\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, with this data structure, for each `query_id` we can easily access the list of retrieved and relevant documents, and compute the performance metrics. We can then average these measures over all the queries to compute the mean performance of the IR system on the given retrieval task.\n",

To identify key functional molecules, we used differential messenger RNA (mRNA) display and compared RNA populations isolated from the defined transition phases (proliferation, matrix formation, and mineralization) of the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cell line. Using this approach, a complementary DNA (cDNA) fragment was isolated and identified as neuroleukin (NLK), a multifunctional cytokine also known as autocrine motility factor (AMF), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI; phosphohexose isomerase [PHI]), and maturation factor (MF). Northern analysis showed NLK temporal expression during MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation with a 3.5-fold increase during matrix formation and mineralization. Immunocytochemical studies revealed the presence of NLK in MC3T3-E1 cells as well as in the surrounding matrix, consistent with a secreted molecule. In contrast, the NLK receptor protein was detected primarily on the cell membrane. In subsequent studies, a high level of NLK expression was identified in osteoblasts and superficial articular chondrocytes in bone of 1-, 4-, and 8-month-old normal mice, as well as in fibroblasts, proliferating chondrocytes, and osteoblasts within a fracture callus. However, NLK was not evident in hypertrophic chondrocytes or osteocytes. In addition, treatment of MC3T3 cells with 6-phosphogluconic acid (6PGA; a NLK inhibitor) resulted in diminishing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells, especially during the matrix formation stage of differentiating cells.

We analyzed the clinico-biological features of 61 immunologically typical (CD5+CD23+) B-CLL patients stratified according to the CD38 expression. Twenty-two (36%) patients expressed CD38 in more than 30% of CD19-positive cells and were considered as CD38-positive B-CLL. Atypical morphology (p 0.02), peripheral blood lymphocytosis (p 0.01) and diffuse histopathologic bone marrow pattern (p 0.003) were findings found to be closely associated with CD38 expression.

There is a pressing need to determine rapidly the regions recognized by these antibodies and the structural requirements required within AMA1 for high affinity binding of the MAbs. Using phage displaying random AMA1 fragments, it was shown that MAb5G8 recognizes a short linear epitope within the pro-domain of AMA1 whereas the epitope recognized by MAb 1F9 is reduction sensitive and resides within a disulphide-bonded 57 amino acid sub-domain of domain-1.

To gain insight into this aspect, we looked at the relationship between two of these mechanisms in endometrial stroma and the melanoma system for which the ability to create an environment of immune privilege has been well established. METHOD OF STUDY: Media conditioned by endometrial stromal cultures and malignant melanoma A375 were examined to test their effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cell-mediated cytotoxicity directed against K562 target. Moreover, these media were tested for the concentration of the soluble form of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), which has been suggested as a marker for spreading potential. RESULTS: Media conditioned by endometrial stromal cultures exerted a significant suppressive effect on cell cytotoxicity when compared with those derived from malignant melanoma Moreover, the constitutive release of sICAM-1 was significantly higher in supernatants from endometrial stromal than in melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that two specific properties suggested to be involved in the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system are more pronounced in the endometrium than in a malignant melanoma.

One of her sisters and a niece are also deaf and have goiter as well. The presence of Pendred's syndrome was confirmed by a positive perchlorate test and the demonstration of a Mondini malformation. Thyroid function tests (under levothyroxine [LT4] therapy) were in the euthyroid range with a thyrotropin [TSH] level of 2.8 microU/mL (0.2-3.2), a serum total thyroxine (T4) of 90 nmol/L (54-142), and a serum total triiodothyronine (T3) of 2.7 nmol/L (0.8-2.4). Total thyroidectomy was performed, and the mass in the right lobe was found to have invaded adjacent tissues. The histopathological findings were consistent with a follicular carcinoma with areas of anaplastic transformation and lung metastasis. The patient was treated twice with 100 mCi 131iodine (3,700 MBq) and received suppressive doses of LT4. Postoperatively, the serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels remained markedly elevated (2,352 to 41,336 ng/mL). The patient died of a sudden severe episode of hemoptysis. Sequence analysis of the PDS gene performed with DNA from the two relatives with Pendred's syndrome revealed the presence of a deletion of thymidine 279 in exon 3, a point mutation that results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon at codon 96 in the pendrin molecule. We concluded that prolonged TSH stimulation because of iodine deficiency or dyshormonogenesis in combination with mutations of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes, may result in the development of follicular thyroid carcinomas that undergo transformation into anaplastic cancers. It is likely that these pathogenetic mechanisms have been involved in the development of aggressive metastatic thyroid cancer in this unusual patient with Pendred's syndrome.\", 'AD': 'Thyroid Unit, Hospital das Clinicas FMUSP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'CY': 'United States', 'DA': '20011121', 'DCOM': '20020522', 'DP': '2001 Oct', 'EDAT': '2001/11/22 10:00', 'IP': '10', 'IS': '1050-7256', 'JID': '9104317', 'LA': 'eng', 'MHDA': '2002/05/25 10:01', 'PG': '981-8', 'PMID': '11716048', 'PST': 'ppublish', 'PT': 'Journal Article', 'SB': 'IM', 'SO': 'Thyroid 2001 Oct;11(10):981-8.', 'TA': 'Thyroid', 'TI': \"Aggressive metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma with anaplastic transformation arising from a long-standing goiter in a patient with Pendred's syndrome.\", 'UI': '21572133', 'VI': '11', 'MH': ['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anaplasia', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Case Report', 'Consanguinity', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Deafness/*complications/congenital/*genetics', 'Female', 'Goiter/*complications/*genetics', 'Human', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Male', 'Middle Age', 'Mutation', 'Pedigree', \"Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\", 'Syndrome', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*complications/genetics/pathology'], 'RN': ['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (sulfate transporter)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)'], 'FAU': ['Camargo, R', 'Limbert, E', 'Gillam, M', 'Henriques, M M', 'Fernandes, C', 'Catarino, A L', 'Soares, J', 'Alves, V A', 'Kopp, P', 'Medeiros-Neto, G']}}]}})"
